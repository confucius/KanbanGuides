Professional Kanban is defined completely in the Kanban Guide that was created by a community of Kanban practitioners.

This guide was (is) developed with the help and support of many Kanban practioners. It is our pledge that we will continue to promote a safe, diverse, and inclusive community so that all who participate can benefit. As a starting point to that end, this guide is offered free to anyone who wishes to use it.
